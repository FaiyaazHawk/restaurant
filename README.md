# restaurant
Basic restaurant site using Webpack bundler
Created a 3 tabbed page for a restaurant.
Main goal of this project was to work using webpack.
Content is changed purely using DOM manipulation via JavaScript.
Styling is still done via individual style sheets.

What I learned:

-Basic webpack workflow
-Writing JS code as modules and exporting them to other modules for use.
